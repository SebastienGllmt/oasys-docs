# Cross Chain Bridge

Many bridges create different versions of the currency, including many stablecoins. 
This issue causes much inconvenience, and even if you want to use one currency, different bridges create different tokens, which leads to incompatibility and bad UX. 
<!-- TRANSLATION: Not quite sure what is meant below by connected to the outside world -->
Oasys thinks that's a critical point, and it's been thinking a lot since it first connected to the outside world. 

<!-- TRANSLATION: Not quite sure what is meant here with partners who are not uncomfortable -->
- Partners who are connected to many networks and are not uncomfortable
- Reliable Partners

Celer has many connections to other networks, which leads to scalability with other chains.  
We'll carefully consider and accept new partners that may come in later, so users can use stable bridges.
