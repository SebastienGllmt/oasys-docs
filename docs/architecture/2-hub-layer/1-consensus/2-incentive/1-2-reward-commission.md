# Reward / Commission

## How block reward is made
Block Reward have two different details.

1. Gas used on Block
Gas used on Block means if you are a Validator and you have created Block, you will receive a gas fee used on Block. For example, if 50OAS used gas fee on Block, you would receive approx 50OAS(Subject to EIP-1559 Standard). Therefore, the Validator operator receives a gas fee on Block.

2. Validation Reward(Operation Reward)
Since Gas used on Block can not stimulate the ecosystem and motivate validators to secure our network, we have a reward for validators who participated in each epoch. In addition, Delegator and Validator Owner receive a reward. Validation Reward(Operation Reward) is calculated at the end of each epoch, and you can see a timer in the Oasys hub.
