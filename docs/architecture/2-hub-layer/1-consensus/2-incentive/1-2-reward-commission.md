# Reward / Commission

## How block reward is made
Block Reward have two different details.

1. Gas used on Block
Gas used on Block means if you are a Validator and you have created Block, you will receive a gas fee used on Block. If 50OAS used gas fee on Block, you would receive approx 50OAS(Subject to EIP-1559 Standard). Validator operator receive gas fee on block.

2. Validation Reward(Operation Reward)
Since Gas used on Block can not stimulate the ecosystem and motivate validators to secure our network, we have a reward for validators who participated in each epoch. Delegator and Validator Owner receives reward. Validation Reward(Operation Reward) is calculated at the end of each epoch, and you can see a timer in oasys hub
