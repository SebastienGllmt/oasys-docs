# Multi Layered Architecture

The Hub Layer is designed to handle only specific transactions. This prevents many transactions from occurring, preventing the gas fee from rising during roll-up, and does not burden the user even if the gasp rises. 
Verse Layer will be responsible for the transactions of significant games.

Oasys can solve with flexibility.

- For large projects, a public chain is established for each product. 
- Multiple games can configure one version 
- High TPS
- Fast Finality 

High speed, High Finality can be considered low Network Resilience, but Oasys validate all transactions by Hub Layer validators.
