# Multi Layered Architecture

The Hub Layer is designed to handle only specific tx. This prevents many transactions from occurring, preventing the gasp from rising during roll-up, and does not burden the user even if the gasp rises. 
Verse Layer will be responsible for the tx of significant games.

The important parts are as follows. 

- For large projects, a public chain is established for each product. 
- Multiple games can configure one version 
- High TPS
- Fast Finality 

High speed, High Finality can be considered low Network Resilience, but we validate all transactions by Hub Layer validators.
Also, due to the nature of the game pie, the game operator runs Verse in Oasys, and because it's their game, you can trust the person who runs Verse, and in fact, most transactions occur in Verse. So we think, reliability & Scam resistance is the most important thing.
