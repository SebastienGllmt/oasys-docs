# Flexible Token Design

You can look with [Whitepaper](/docs/whitepaper/solution/ft-nft-design) for flexible token design.

Since we have ex,o,v FT & NFT in our network, we'd like to tell you why we have made many token designs. 
From architecting Oasys, we've seen many IP holders are afraid to expose their IP.

For example, if you have your own IP with particular behaviour or personality, like kind and lovely. 
Some scammers can take your IP and use it with different personalities or some behaviour that can harm your IP's identity. 

This might be crucial for IP holders, so sometimes they need to protect IP whatever they take. 
On Oasys, if you use vNFT, you can solve this issue. 

Of course, If you need to move around your IP with multi-chain, you can make it with oNFT or exNFt. 
This flexibility can make with FT also. In addition, you can choose an internal currency or global currency in your option with Oasys Network.
