# Flexible Token Design

You can look with [Whitepaper](/docs/whitepaper/solution/ft-nft-design) for flexible token design.

Since Oasys have ex,o,v FT & NFT in our network, we'd like to tell you why we have made many token designs. 
From architecting Oasys, we've seen many IP holders are afraid to expose their IP.

If you need to move around your IP with multi-chain, you can make it with oNFT or exNFt. 
This flexibility can make with FT also. In addition, you can choose an internal currency or global currency in your option with Oasys Network.
