# Crypto Faucets

The crypto faucet is a service that distributes a certain amount of crypto currency to users as compensation for performing small missions.

The metaphor is based on the fact that even a drop of water from a leaky faucet can eventually fill a cup. There are various types of crypto faucets such as BTC, ETH, and BNB.

Most crypto faucets distribute testnet's crypto currency as compensation, providing free crypto currency for users to learn and invest completely, and making it easier to develop Dapps with free crypto currency received by developers.

There is no need for formal education or knowledge to receive compensation from these crypto faucets, but only a wallet address to store the rewarded crypto currency.

## Most of the tasks of the crypto faucets are as follows
1. Watch paid ads that exist within the crypto faucet service to clear the mission.
2. You can complete the mission by participating in a crypto faucet service quiz or survey.
3. You can test secure characters in the crypto faucet service and log in every day to clear the mission.

## Advantages and disadvantages of crypto faucet
1. Unlike transactions and investments that require financial risks, crypto currency can be obtained free of charge by spending time on simple missions.
2. Usually, there is no limit on the number of times you can receive free crypto currency from the crypto faucet, and the amount of crypto currency you receive depends on the number of tasks completed.
3. Some fraudulent websites disguised as faucets can infect your PC with malicious code, so you should work with a validated faucet.
4. The reward of the crypto faucet can be a waste of time because it is not equal to the time and energy spent on the task performed.
