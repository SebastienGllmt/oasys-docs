# Crypto Faucets

The crypto faucet is a service that distributes a certain amount of crypto currency to users as compensation for performing small missions.

The metaphor is based on the fact that even a drop of water from a leaky faucet can eventually fill a cup. 

Most crypto faucets distribute testnet's crypto currency as compensation, providing free crypto currency for users to learn and invest completely, and making it easier to develop Dapps with free crypto currency received by developers.

There is no need for formal education or knowledge to receive compensation from these crypto faucets, but only a wallet address to store the rewarded crypto currency.
