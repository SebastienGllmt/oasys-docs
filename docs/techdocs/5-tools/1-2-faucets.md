# Crypto Faucets

The crypto faucet is a service that distributes a certain amount of cryptocurrency to users as compensation for performing small missions.

The metaphor is based on the fact that even a drop of water from a leaky faucet can eventually fill a cup. 

Most crypto faucets distribute testnet's cryptocurrency as compensation, providing free cryptocurrency for users to learn and invest entirely and making it easier to develop Dapps with free cryptocurrency received by developers.

There is no need for formal education or knowledge to receive compensation from these crypto faucets, only a wallet address to store the rewarded cryptocurrency.
