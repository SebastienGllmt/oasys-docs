# Selecting as a builder in Oasys

![select](/img/docs/techdocs/verse/select.png)

The table shows how game companies can start business on Oasys. 

The games on Oasys will only be on L2, which means it will require a place, an L2, Verse-Layer, to deploy games. As a result, game companies will have to decide between two options: 
1. Deploy solely game titles
2. Become a verse builder and deploy their own games and/or games sourced from 3rd-parties.


## Build a Verse

In principle, anyone with a deposit of 1 million OAS tokens can create an L2 on Oasys.



### Onboarding (migrating)

In the case of onboarding games on existing verses, direct contact is recommended for the smooth onboarding of game titles.
