# Selecting as a builder in Oasys

The games on Oasys will only be on L2, which means it will require a place, an L2, Verse-Layer, to deploy games. As a result, game companies will have to decide between two options: 
1. Deploy solely game titles
2. Become a verse builder and deploy their own games and/or games sourced from 3rd-parties.

## Build a Game

### 1. Deploying a game on Oasys

In order to deploy a game on Oasys, it is required to have a verse-layer (L2 of Oasys), either one of existing ones, or a new verse-layer built by a game company. Below flow chart describes the steps required to deploy your game.

### 2. Selecting a verse partner

If a game company is looking to deploy a game title without building its own verse, a game company needs to get in touch with respective verse builders. Oasys team can also help respective game companies to be connected with respective verse builders.

### 3. Registering your game and verse on Oasys Hub

There are two types of registration for builders to make in order to be displayed on Oasys Hub (https://hub.oasys.games/). 
After building a verse, a new verse builder needs to register necessary information through the below registration form. 

#### ✅Oasys Verse Registration for Oasys Hub

 Another registration is game title registration, which is recommended to be aligned with verse builders for game registration.

In case any confirmation for registration through either forms is needed, please reach out to the Oasys team for support. 

## Build a Verse

In principle, anyone with a deposit of 1 million OAS tokens can create an L2 on Oasys.

The rest of this document describes the technical manual in order for game companies to deploy a verse layer. In order to deploy a L2 contract, potential verse builders are required to deposit 1,000,000 OAS tokens as a minimum requirement, which will be returned to the depositor(s) after approximately 180 days. OAS tokens can be purchased from below exchanges (as of Dec 31, 2022).

In the case of onboarding games on existing verses, direct contact is recommended for the smooth onboarding of game titles.
