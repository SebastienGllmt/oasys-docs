# Selecting as a builder in Oasys



The table shows how game companies can start business on Oasys. 

The games on Oasys will only be on L2, which means it will require a place, an L2, Verse-Layer, to deploy games. As a result, game companies will have to decide between two options: 
1. Deploy solely game titles
2. Become a verse builder and deploy their own games and/or games sourced from 3rd-parties.

## Build a Verse

As previously stated, in order to deploy game contents on Oasys, the selection or creation of a receiving Verse is required first.

In principle, anyone with a deposit of 1 million OAS tokens can create an L2 on Oasys. Although technical requirements would allow builders to develop L2s, this does not imply that everyone is a trustworthy subject. In other words, a reliable operator is both a safe and dependable subject inside the Oasys ecosystem and an Oasys partner at the same time. As part of this process, Oasys continues to put efforts in keeping the ecosystem balanced and improved by providing various supports including the grant.



The first stage in becoming the verified verse builder would be to develop a business plan based on application form questions. The application for the Verse Builder Grant may thereafter be accessible if conditions are met.

Technical assistance for integration and marketing (both verse and game) will be offered throughout the VB onboarding process.

Following the completion of these steps, the game title will be announced, onboarding will begin, and the game will be released.

## Verified Verse

The responsibility of the verse builder on the Oasys blockchain is the Web3 Game Publisher of Multiple Games on Oasys. The verse builder must have 3 capabilities across the verse-building spectrum. First, stable management of the platform is required in terms of business, governance, and security. In perspective of business, cash and cash equivalents must be secured in order to serve as a safety net to prevent a verse builder from ending its service owing to liquidity issues. In terms of working capital, it is preferable to determine what could be the bare minimum (burn rate). As to governance, Team members must have the following track records: 1) RW credential (i.e. resume, LinkedIn), 2) Digital credential (i.e. Twitter, FB, blogs, etc.). To eliminate the chance of service termination owing to governance reasons, investors and advisors must be present. In the matter of security, the chain operation should be illustrated, including server management (which server to use) and key management (i.e. server login).

Second, the ability to acquire games is essential. Onboarding first party games requires the company’s own or subsidiaries’ game development and publishing capacity. To acquire third party games, the verse builder must have the sales and support capacity. The scope of support capacity includes the following areas: (a) technology: engineers, customer service, (b) own tools marketing: influencing ability, web3 marketing experience, (c) blockchain game consulting: legal, tax-related, tokenomics, and (d) others: industry connection, BO support, and financing support.

Last but not the least, mid-to long-term maintenance is required even after the launch of games.
