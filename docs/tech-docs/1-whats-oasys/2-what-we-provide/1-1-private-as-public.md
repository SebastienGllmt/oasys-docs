# Generate Your Own Public Chain by Verse

## Problem

When you make a game, there's much interaction. That's why it takes much processing on the network, and game servers talk about cloud or scalability. When we were designing Oasys, when we first thought about a game, we found that many chains were designed for general purposes, not just for a game. 

Commonly designed chains are suitable for many people, but they're used in many areas, not in many places, and they use a variety of networks, not a dedicated network, which has many disadvantages for game operators. 

In particular, as we use the network with Abitrazi, such as Defi, or transactions of bots, game operators also feel that unwanted parts are included on a chain. 


## Solution 

1. Easy Public chain with Infrastructure 

Game companies often own their own servers, and even if they use the cloud, they need to connect with their games. Using Oasys does easy work with a dedicated chain. 

2. Dedicated TPS for Builders

The limit of the TPS commonly referred to as the EVM chain, is 3000 to 4000. Therefore, the limitation of single-core rendering, and when it is multi-core rendering, can result in less stability in the network. 
From the builder's point of view, if you monopolize transactions that occur in one version of Oasys or combine multiple versions into a single model, you can match 100,000 TPS compared to the 3000-4000 TPS chain. 

3. Decentralized with a Fast module 

The L2 deployed by Oasys is supplied with dispersibility from the Hub Layer, which is responsible for the most critical safety layer in the blockchain.
