# Incentive Logic

## Staking Reward

Staking rewards are a must for the architecture of POS. Therefore, for the stability of the network, we have assigned Staking Rewards on Tokenomics. POS validates the network through the Proof of Staking. Staking reward is calculated in every epoch.

## Commission 

Belly data, while belly-dating, stabilises the network and mediates transactions. 
The delegator can delegate the token to the Validator, the Validator can receive a delegated token, and the Validator can receive commissions from the delegator. 

## Miner Incentives 

The person who created the block is called Miner. Miners receive the gas fee used in the block. Under the EIP1559 standard, a small amount of gas fee will burn, and the gas fee used in the block will be paid to the Validator Owner.
