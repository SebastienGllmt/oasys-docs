# Cross Chain Bridge

Many bridges create different versions of the currency, including many stablecoins. 
This issue causes much inconvenience, and even if you want to use one currency, different bridges create different tokens, which leads to incompatibility and bad UX. 
Oasys thinks that's a critical point, and it's been thinking a lot since it first connected to the outside world. 

- Partners who are connected to many networks and are not uncomfortable
- Reliable Partners

Celer has many connections to other networks. This means scalability with other chains.  
We will carefully consider and accept new partners that may come in later, so users can use stable bridges.
