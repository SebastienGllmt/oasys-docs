# Tokenomics
## Overview
Oasys' native token is the OAS token, and the total supply at launch is 10 billion tokens. Six years after the mainnet launch, OAS token holders will determine the additional supply of staking rewards through decentralized governance.
## Token Utilities
OAS tokens have following uses.
### 1. Gas Fees
Due to the architecture of Oasys, the Verse Builder pays gas fees for transaction roll-ups to the Hub Layer.
### 2. Verse Building Deposits
Anyone can build a Verse if they deposit more than 1 million OAS toward the verse contract.
### 3. Decentralized Governance
OAS token holders can participate in Oasys' decision-making through decentralized governance. Proposals include changes in inflation rates through staking, treasury uses, etc.
### 4. Staking Rewards
Staking OAS tokens allows you to receive staking rewards. Anyone staking 10 million OAS or more through a validator contract can become a validator.
### 5. Payment
OAS tokens can be used to purchase NFTs and other products.

## Initial Token Allocation
The total initial supply is 10 billion OAS tokens which will be distributed according to the following allocations.

### Staking Rewards (21.0%)

### Development (15.0%)

### Foundation (12.0%)

## Token Supply Curve
Circulating supply must be a well-balanced design that considers the long-term growth and sustainability of Oasys.
