# Hardware Requirement


## Intro
Blockchain it self stores data onto decentralized storage. Syncing block, Sharing block it self makes stable usage for blockchain network. 
Since producing more block needs storage, if system elapsed time, and stacked lots of block, you may have to increase disk storage for stable node operations on future.

## Hub-Layer Hardware Requirements
